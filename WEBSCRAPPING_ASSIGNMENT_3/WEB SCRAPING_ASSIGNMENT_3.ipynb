I’m just thinking outside the box. So let’s say in fast 11 the crew is back and officially home to stay in LA. Cypher is dead and everything is back to normal again. But now they have one final score to deal with and it’s DK. Dk has nothing left and he’s in LA running things heavy after being kicked out of the Akuza gang in Tokyo after losing to Han. He’s now running big races and Mafia stuff going on. Let’s say from fast and furious one the guy that Brian shot off the bike while chasing dom had connections with Dk peoples back in Tokyo. But turns out That Guy that Brian Killed was actually DK’s older brother and is the reason why DK was doing his thing in Tokyo to keep connections going. So now that Dk has lost everything in Tokyo he moved to LA to help out with his brother behind the scenes. Now remind you if I’m wrong but during that timeline Han and Sean was doing there thing in Tokyo right? So fast and furious was in 2001. Fast and furious four Han was with Dom and Went back to Tokyo after finding out the cops were hot on Dom. All of that takes place right after fast and furious 1. So DK brother had already died but he didn’t get the memo till later after the lost of Sean. So my theory DK is in LA now running the operation thing that his brother was doing. And when he finds out that Dom was the one who played a part in his brother dying he’s going to go after him and especially knowing that Sean and Nila are here in LA as well and let alone Han still being alive it’s really going to be some Vendetta behind it. I feel This Time DK would come back with more force and Power knowing who Dom is and his reputation in LA as well. I don’t know I’m jus thinking of stuff guys.
